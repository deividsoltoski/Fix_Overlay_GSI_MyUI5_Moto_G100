Some overlays to fix MyUI5 Android 13 GSI status bar icons on Moto G100/Edge S

Download the Magisk module and install it to fix the status bar icons above the front camera only in GSI MyUI 5 on Android 13

If you prefer to manually copy and replace on the system, you can also do that

Hope you like it :D
